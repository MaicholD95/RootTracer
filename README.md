# RootTracer: An Intuitive Solution for Root Image Annotation

RootTracer is a tool designed for efficient plant root image analysis, allowing users to annotate, modify, and extract RSML files. 
The tool addresses challenges such as complex root structures, occlusions, and inconsistent lighting. 
RootTracer enables manual annotations, modification of existing RSML files, and extraction of root traits like length, convex hull area, and tortuosity. It supports various plant species and integrates intuitive controls for enhanced user experience.
A new dataset for training machine learning models in root segmentation is also introduced, facilitating advancements in root phenotyping and agricultural research.
